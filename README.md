# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Dayjs
Day.js is a minimalist JavaScript library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. Its purpose is to provide a lightweight alternative to moment.js, with a similar API but a much smaller file size. Day.js is often used in web development projects where handling dates and times is necessary but the full functionality and size of moment.js might be overkill. It offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for working with dates and times in JavaScript applications.
